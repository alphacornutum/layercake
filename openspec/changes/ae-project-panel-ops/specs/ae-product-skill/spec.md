## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Document guarded editing workflow

The product skill MUST document the safe mutation workflow: host check → open → `ae_project_context` bind → optional summary → inventory as needed → optional `ae_save_project` `create_backup` → `ae_patch_project` apply → use returned fingerprint (or re-bind context if another mutator may have run) → `ae_save_project` `save_copy`. The skill MUST state that `ae_eval_script` bypasses typed safety and MUST warn not to open over another project without an explicit `ae_close_project` (or save) first. The skill MUST tell agents to prefer typed patch over raw eval for routine text-style fixes and for Project panel create/move/delete (`create_folder`, `move_project_item`, `delete_project_item`), using `Item.id` handles from inventory (including the real root folder id). The skill MUST note that delete follows After Effects defaults (recursive folder remove; in-use items may be deleted), that impact evidence includes nested counts and full `usedInCompIds`, and that patch mutates authored / pre-expression project state without rewriting expression strings as a side effect of panel ops.

#### Scenario: Skill mentions patch and save

- **WHEN** an agent reads the product skill after this capability ships
- **THEN** the skill body MUST mention `ae_project_context`, `ae_patch_project`, and `ae_save_project` and MUST tell agents to prefer typed patch over raw eval for routine fixes

#### Scenario: Skill documents panel ops and fingerprint reuse

- **WHEN** an agent reads the product skill after panel ops ship
- **THEN** the skill MUST mention `create_folder`, `move_project_item`, and `delete_project_item`, MUST warn about recursive folder delete and in-use removal, and MUST state that a successful patch response’s fingerprint MAY be reused for the next save when no other mutator intervened
